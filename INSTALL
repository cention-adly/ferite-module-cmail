Install lib-client:

	Fetch ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z

	Uncompress into a directory using tar Zxvf imap.tar.Z
		- if you get an error, you may need to install 'uncompress' which is part of the ncompress package

	Change to the created directory (imap-2007a in my case)

	Run:
		Mac OSX: make oxp
		Linux:   make ln8

	Let the build process complete.

	Copy c-client/c-client.a to /cention/lib/libc-client.a

	Make the directory /cention/include/c-client-2007a

	Copy c-client/*.h c-client/linkage.* /cention/include/c-client-2007a

	Create a link from /cention/include/c-client-2007a to /cention/include/imap

Then compile and install this module:

	./autogen.sh --with-uw-imap=/cention
	make
	sudo make install
	sudo feritedoc --regenerate
