Install lib-client:

	Fetch ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z

	Uncompress into a directory using tar Zxvf imap.tar.Z
		- if you get an error, you may need to install 'uncompress' which is part of the ncompress package

	Change to the created directory (imap-2007a in my case)

	Run:
		Mac OSX: make oxp
		Linux:   make ln8

		If this step fails due to errors about ssl.h, you probably have SSL in a non-standard place or
		100 other reasons that cause c-client to fail. You can compile without SSL by using the same
		command and appending SSLTYPE=none on the end. e.g.
		
		make ln8 SSLTYPE=none

	Let the build process complete.

	Copy c-client/c-client.a to /cention/lib/libc-client.a

	Make the directory /cention/include/c-client-2007a

	Copy c-client/*.h c-client/linkage.* /cention/include/c-client-2007a

	Create a link from /cention/include/c-client-2007a to /cention/include/imap

Then compile and install this module:

	./autogen.sh --with-uw-imap=/cention
	make
	sudo make install
	sudo feritedoc --regenerate
